This is a bashscript that adds new users to a system. 
The list of users will receive:
> Username + a randomly generated password (that can be changed afterwards).
> A home directory with a copy of the company policy file.
> An email that will be sent to them  containing their login information.
> The credentials file will be deleted off the system after it has been emailed out to the given users.
